  title: 'Love, Detachment, and the Myth of Permanent Commitment',
  date: '2025-07-12',
  excerpt:
    'Love is not a contract. It’s a feeling, and feelings don’t owe you permanence. Commitment is beautiful only when chosen freely — not forced by paperwork, guilt, or children.',
  content: `
Love, at its purest, is not a deal. It is not a religion. It is not a project plan. It is not a social insurance policy where two people sign up and pray the future behaves.

Love is a feeling. And feelings, by definition, are irrational. If you can explain exactly *why* you love someone, you probably don’t.

> “One is very crazy when in love.” — Sigmund Freud

We’re told from every direction — family, films, fucking wedding photographers — that love should lead to permanence. That if you fall in love, you *should* marry. That if you marry, you *should* stay. That if you stay, you *should* have kids. And once you do, you *must* stay. Even if the love dies.

But what happens when the feeling dies, as feelings often do? We don’t just fall *in* love — we fall *out* of it, too.

## Detachment isn’t cruelty. It’s respect.

People think if you let someone go, it means you never loved them. That’s bullshit. You can love someone with your entire being and still let them walk away — not because they’re less lovable, but because you *respect their right to feel differently tomorrow*.

I don’t want someone to stay with me because of guilt, or paperwork, or because it’s “too late” to leave. That’s not love. That’s hostage-taking with rings on.

> “If you love someone, set them free. If they come back, it means no one else wanted them.” — Dry humor. But also, maybe.

## The System Wants You Married

You might think love is a personal emotion. But the system has monetized the hell out of it. Marriage, in today’s world, is a product.

Why does marriage have paperwork? Why does it come with tax breaks, insurance dependencies, social pressure, jewelry ads, baby registries, “How to Save a Failing Marriage” podcasts?

Because **capitalism needs you to commit**. When two people marry, they take on a joint expense. They buy things. They raise future consumers. They stabilize labor output. It’s an economic transaction pretending to be romantic tradition.

> “The goal of capitalism is not love. It is consumption.”

## The Ring Doesn’t Make It Real

You fall in love with someone. You share your days. You talk about movies, insecurities, god, politics. You make each other better — or at least you try.

Then suddenly, there’s pressure. To make it “official.” To get “serious.” To tell your relatives. To “grow up.”

As if the *moment* you say “I do,” your relationship is now valid.

No. It was valid *before*. Maybe more real, in fact — because it was chosen every day. Not bound by legal threads, guilt, or a mortgage.

## Falling Out of Love Isn’t a Sin

People fall out of love. That’s not betrayal. That’s being human.

To me, real maturity is being able to say: “I once loved you with everything. I don’t anymore. And I’m sorry. But I respect you too much to fake it.”

Most people can’t say that — not because they’re evil, but because **the system shames ending things**. You stay. You smile. You rot.

We force marriages to last “for the children.” But no child thrives in a house where love is a ghost. You think kids don’t know?

## Love Must Be Free — Or It Isn’t Love At All

I’ve told people close to me: If you feel like leaving me, just go. I’ll never stop you. Not because I don’t care. But because I *do*. I want people to choose me without guilt. Without pressure. Without needing to lie to themselves.

I want love that’s so alive, it doesn’t need a leash.

And I don’t take it personally when they leave. Why would I? Feelings shift. Timing collapses. Souls misalign. That’s life.

I don’t believe in permanent commitment. I believe in *present commitment*. The kind that says: “I’m here. Right now. And I mean it.”

That’s more than enough for me.

> “Love is the absence of possession.” — Osho

If we stopped expecting love to carry the weight of permanence, maybe we’d love more deeply. More honestly. More like children — who love without shame, without paperwork, without futures attached.

Maybe then, we’d finally be free.

  title: 'The System’s Grip on Freedom, Expression, and Identity',
  date: '2025-07-12',
  excerpt:
    'We like to think we’re free, but most of our “choices” were installed by a system that profits from our predictability. This is a field‑guide to spotting invisible leashes.',
  content: `

Freedom is easy to market and hard to deliver. Everywhere you look, someone is selling “empowerment”—self‑help gurus, job ads, universities, dating apps—but few admit that the *menu* you choose from was fixed long before you sat at the table.

> “The most potent weapon of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed.”  
> — **Steve Biko**

## 1. Choice Architecture: How the System Curates Your “Options”

- **Education** tells you which dreams are “realistic.”  
- **Career ladders** map your ambition into convenient corporate rungs.  
- **Dating apps** reduce intimacy to swipes—optimising hormones for ad revenue.  
- **Social media** sells you anxiety, then retargets you with mindfulness subscriptions.

We pretend to pick freely, but the system built the buffet.

\`\`\`bash
# Pseudo‑freedom 101
user@life$ choices --list | grep "preapproved"
\`\`\`

## 2. Identity as a Product Line

We slice ourselves into “brands”: job title, body type, political tribe, star‑sign, Spotify genre. Why? Because capitalism loves tidy demographics:

1. Easy to target  
2. Easy to predict  
3. Easy to sell

> Simone de Beauvoir warned that society turns people into “Others.”  
> Today, we volunteer for the labeling booth if it comes with free shipping.

### The Algorithm of Alienation

1. Tell you you’re unique.  
2. Show you an ad proving you’re not quite enough.  
3. Offer a product to bridge that gap.  
4. Repeat until death (or enlightenment—whichever monetises better).

## 3. Work: The Soft Prison with Free Coffee

Modern offices replaced factory whistles with Slack pings.  
Same constraint, better branding.

- **9 AM stand‑up** → demonstrate loyalty  
- **OKRs** → measurable obedience  
- **“We’re a family”** → emotional blackmail wearing a hoodie

Karl Marx talked about alienation; HR renamed it “culture fit.”  
Smells nicer, chains the same.

> “It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.”  
> — **Jiddu Krishnamurti**

## 4. Why Rage Gets You Shadow‑Banned

Real dissent is inconvenient:

1. It doesn’t click‑convert.  
2. It frightens sponsors.  
3. It reminds the comfortable that comfort is built on someone else’s discomfort.

So the system filters rage into acceptable hashtags: post, vent, forget.  
Outrage monetised, revolution postponed.

## 5. Education Versus Indocrination

School should expand minds; often it standardises them.

- **Grades** teach compliance over curiosity.  
- **Curriculum** omits anything that critiques its funders.  
- **Career counselling** funnels talent into “high‑growth sectors” (translation: profitable).

Einstein said, *“It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.”*  
Twenty‑first‑century miracle: that creativity survives KPI dashboards.

## 6. Escaping the Invisible Cages

1. **Name the cage** — you can’t break walls you refuse to see.  
2. **Detach worth from productivity** — your value isn’t your output.  
3. **Practice inconvenient honesty** — systems thrive on polite silence.  
4. **Build micro‑freedoms** — unmonetised hobbies, offline friendships, joy without an audience.

## 7. Hope Without Hallmark

Hope isn’t a motivational quote in a pastel font.  
It’s the stubborn act of imagining alternatives when the world insists none exist.

> Albert Camus wrote, “The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.”

Freedom begins when you decide some parts of you are **not for sale**.  
Your silence, your Sunday morning, your last authentic nerve—these are your seeds.  
Protect them. Water them. Share them only with people who don’t invoice your soul.

---

### TL;DR

- Most of what we call “freedom” is curated convenience.  
- Identity is profitable when it’s predictable; resist tidy labels.  
- The system hates unmonetised joy—practice it daily.  
- Rage is data; turn it into agency, not just hashtags.  
- Your humanity is not a subscription plan—cancel the trial, keep the soul.

End of rant. Feel free to reboot the matrix—or at least put it on mute for a while.

  title: 'Lust, Shame, and the Politics of Sexual Agency',
  date: '2025-07-12',
  excerpt:
    'Why is lust demonized unless it’s marketable? Why are women shamed for what men are celebrated for? A brutal, tender essay on agency, shame, and the liberation of desire.',
  content: `

Let’s get this out of the way:

**Lust isn’t sin.** It’s biology. It’s chemistry. It’s what makes your heart race, skin flush, throat dry. It’s the electricity before the kiss.

So why does society treat it like a confession?

## 1. Lust: The Feeling You’re Taught to Hide

Lust is punished unless it’s marketable.

- If it’s in a perfume ad? Empowering.  
- If it’s on a woman’s face when she’s not selling anything? Indecent.  
- If a man feels it? Normal.  
- If a woman owns it? *Scandalous.*

We’re trained to **frame desire in shame**, especially if it’s feminine. The same act gets applauded or demonized based on *who’s doing it* and *who’s profiting*.

> “The body is not an apology.”  
> — Sonya Renee Taylor

## 2. The Double Standard: Playboy vs “Slut”

Let’s be honest: a man who sleeps with 10 people is a legend.  
A woman who does the same is a cautionary tale.

- His name gets cheered.  
- Hers gets whispered.  
- His life is a movie.  
- Hers is a warning.

**Why?** Because patriarchy has always coded sex as conquest.  
When a man desires, it’s dominance. When a woman desires, it’s danger.

> “Patriarchy has no gender.” — bell hooks

## 3. What’s So Threatening About a Woman Who Wants?

Agency.

A woman who owns her sexuality isn’t a puzzle to solve, a prize to win, a virtue to guard. She’s a sovereign being. That terrifies people raised to believe women are either *mothers* or *mysteries*.

Sexual agency destroys the male savior complex.  
It unplugs the entire fairy-tale machinery.

> “A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.” — Gloria Steinem

## 4. Pornstars and the Hypocrisy of Morality

Millions watch porn every day—but judge those who perform in it.

A leaked celebrity sex tape gets **millions of views**, but the woman in it gets **a lifetime of shame**. Why?

Because pleasure is allowed only when it’s **private**, **male-centered**, and **silent**.

Let’s be clear:

- A pornstar can be a mother.  
- A pornstar can be gentle.  
- A pornstar can love, cry, grieve, heal.  
- A pornstar is a human being.

The shame isn’t theirs. It’s **ours**, for watching them in secret and scorning them in public.

## 5. Consent Isn’t a Buzzword — It’s a Boundary

The same system that glorifies male lust **ignores female consent**.

Men are taught to take.  
Women are taught to be “nice.”  
So when violence happens, people ask, “What was she wearing?”  
instead of “Why was he never taught about *boundaries*?”

> “Rape is not about sex. It’s about power.” — Andrea Dworkin

## 6. Shame Is a Tool of Control

Religious texts, schools, aunties at weddings, HR policies—they all teach one thing:

**If you want something, hide it.**

But what if we didn’t?

What if desire was just a conversation?  
What if we let people choose without fear?  
What if love and lust weren’t separated like church and state?

## 7. Liberation Begins With Owning What You Want

Desire isn’t dirty.  
It’s not a glitch.  
It’s not something to “confess.”

It’s part of being human.

Lust is not love, but it’s also not violence.  
It only becomes dangerous when we pretend it’s evil, when we bury it, and when we punish others for expressing what we secretly feel.

---

### TL;DR

- Lust is normal. Shame is taught.  
- Women deserve sexual agency without being labeled.  
- Pornstars are humans, not avatars for your guilt.  
- Consent is the baseline, not a buzzword.  
- Wanting something doesn’t make you dirty. Pretending you don’t want it? That’s the real problem.

Own your body. Own your wants. And if someone tries to shame you for it—ask yourself:  
**Who benefits from your silence?**`

  date: '2025-07-12',
  excerpt:
    'Why do we judge so fast? Why does every label divide us? A deeply personal piece about alienation, identity, and the silent violence of being boxed in.',
  content: `

I think there's no such thing as a disabled person.

Not in the way society says.

Disability is not in the body. It's in the gaze. The gaze that says: “This isn’t normal.” But what is? If the mere existence of something makes it real, then it is, by definition, natural.

We’ve narrowed the spectrum of what it means to be human. We’ve squeezed it into shapes and sizes that work for power. For safety. For predictability. And then we shame the rest.

We throw around labels: **autistic**, **depressed**, **disabled**, **queer**, **left**, **right**, **ugly**, **weird**, **bad**. But we rarely stop to ask — what are we *protecting* when we use them? Who benefits?

> “The most violent weapon on earth is the table fork.” — Mahatma Gandhi

Not because it cuts — but because it divides.

---

### The Gaze Defines the Monster

When someone sees a child with a stutter, they don’t hear his poetry. They hear delay. When someone sees a person with a wheelchair, they don’t see the curiosity in their questions. They see "pity." 

It’s not about mobility. It’s about how we define value.

A man with one leg climbs Everest, and people call him an inspiration. But if he works a normal desk job, we ignore him entirely.

Why?

Because the story isn't valid unless it entertains *us*.

---

### Labels Are Convenient. People Are Not.

There’s a reason political discourse has turned into shouting matches.

Because when I call you **leftist**, and you call me **right-winger**, we both stop being human. I’m no longer someone who grew up poor, who watched his father die of cancer in a hospital that reeked of neglect. You’re no longer someone who fears change because change has always meant pain.

We're just tokens.

> “Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.” — Carl Jung

But we don’t want understanding. We want clarity. Neat answers. Predictable enemies.

---

### Why Can't a Pornstar Be a Mother?

Yes, I said it. Why not?

Millions watch porn. Millions of people **jerk off** to those women. But suddenly, when the same woman wants to adopt a child, marry, or walk into a school meeting — she becomes “unfit.”

Unfit for whom?

Her feelings are real. Her love is real. Her capacity for care, kindness, rage, boredom — **real**. 

But society wears hypocrisy like a uniform.

A sex tape leaks, and the men who publicly preach righteousness are the first to search for it. An actress' nudes are leaked, and instead of being angry at the invasion, they say: “Well, she shouldn’t have taken them.”

You didn't just steal her privacy. You stole her **right to be human**.

---

### The World is Not Binary

If you think this is about politics, you missed the point.

This is about humanity. 

Every time you box someone in, you box yourself too. You limit what you can feel, what you can imagine, what you can love.

A leftist and a rightist could share the same grief. A wheelchair user and a marathon runner could love the same song. A pornstar and a schoolteacher could both hate mornings.

But we’ll never know — because we didn’t ask.

---

### The Only Truth Is the One That Lets Everyone Exist

I’m not preaching relativism. I’m not saying everything is valid. I’m saying — **look again**.

Look past the label. Ask someone what they miss. What they cry about when the lights are off. What they were like before the world told them who they were.

We’re all fragments. But those fragments can connect — if we let them.

Because if we don’t, we’ll die knowing everyone’s labels and no one’s soul.

  title: 'The Psychology of Men, Patriarchy, and Performative Anger',
  date: '2025-07-12',
  excerpt:
    'Why is anger a man’s first response to violation? Why not grief? Why not care? A long-form meditation on masculinity, vengeance, and the performance of being “strong.”',
  content: `

A woman is raped. And someone — her father, her boyfriend, her brother — hears about it.

He’s *angry*.

That’s his first feeling. Not horror. Not sorrow. Not silence, trembling in empathy. **Anger.**  
The same emotion we express when our car gets scratched.

And then, perhaps, he says he wants to “kill the rapist.”

Not help the woman.  
Not sit with her grief.  
Not ask what she wants.  
Just — *kill*.

But here’s the question:

**Who is that anger really for?**

Does he feel rage because she’s hurt — or because *he* feels dishonored?

Does he care about her healing — or about *his own role* as the failed protector?

> “He who does not bellow the truth when he knows the truth makes himself the accomplice of liars and forgers.”  
> — Charles Péguy

This isn’t protection. It’s performance.

Because if he truly cared, he’d ask her:  
“What do you need from me?”  
And then he’d shut up and listen.

But instead, he turns it into *his* trauma.  
*His* fury.  
*His* script.

This is what patriarchy teaches men — not to love, but to avenge.  
Not to comfort, but to conquer.

And here’s the real twist:

What if the victim was a porn star?  
Would that same man still feel righteous anger?

Or would he mumble,  
“She probably asked for it”?  
“She’s used to that stuff, right?”  
“Attention-seeking.”

Because suddenly, her pain isn’t pain — it’s narrative inconvenience.  
Her history disqualifies her from compassion.

**So the question isn't just: Why are men angry?**  
The real question is: **Why are they so selective about *who* they get angry for?**

It’s not justice. It’s purity politics.  
If she’s someone you can *claim*, she’s worth your tears.  
If she isn’t, she’s disposable.

This is how society trains men to think.  
Not in questions of empathy, but of ownership.  
A woman’s worth isn’t her mind, her music taste, her laugh at 2am —  
It’s her *purity*, her *status*, her *usefulness* to male narratives.

A man can sleep with 10 women and be called a “player.”  
A woman does it and she’s “damaged.”  
Because when a man “conquers” a woman, he’s elevated.  
When a woman owns her sexuality, the system goes into existential panic.

> “When you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.”  
> — Unknown, but deeply accurate

Rape, then, becomes not just a crime of lust, but of power.  
A man who sees a woman as a full, thinking, feeling *human* — cannot rape her.  
You can’t violate what you recognize as your equal.

But a system that teaches boys to view women as *things*?  
As jokes, as objects, as risks, as rewards —  
That system is raising future rapists.

The solution isn’t more angry men with guns.  
It’s more men who know how to grieve.

More men who sit next to a victim and say,  
“You’re not alone.”  
Not “I’ll kill him,”  
but “What do *you* want me to do?”

That’s strength.

That’s revolution.

That’s what men were never taught.

  title: 'Globalization and the Psychological Fracture of the Modern Man',
  date: '2025‑07‑12',
  excerpt:
    'He wanted to study history. But the world had already made up its mind about what intelligence looked like. When society turns survival into competition, what’s left of the soul?',
  content: `

There was a boy. He didn’t want to code. He didn’t want to run Google Ads or make pitch decks. He just wanted to study history.

He loved stories—real ones, messy ones, the ones where empires fall and kings cry. He read about the Indus Valley with the same hunger others brought to gaming laptops or crypto coins. He wasn't less intelligent. But in a world that worships software, he was invisible.

And that's how alienation begins.

---

## A Society that Punishes Passion

Globalization didn’t just open borders. It closed imaginations. Suddenly, only some skills had value—tech, finance, scalability. Suddenly, intelligence had a shape, a dress code, a salary band. Passion? Useless unless it fit a job description.

What happens to the boy who studied history?

He watches his peers become engineers—not because they love it, but because it's "safe." He watches the world reward those who play by rules he never agreed to. And slowly, a thought creeps in: _"Maybe I am the problem."_ That’s how insecurity metastasizes into rage.

He isn’t just unemployed. He’s unseen. And invisibility breeds chaos.

---

## Alienation Is Not an Excuse—But It Is an Origin

Let’s be clear: pain doesn’t justify cruelty. But if we don’t understand where the fracture starts, we’ll never stop the bleeding. We’re not born sociopaths—we’re made. By systems that teach us to equate worth with output. By schools that train us for obedience, not meaning. By economies that turn humans into roles.

Globalization told us it would make the world better. Maybe it did—for some. But for many, it just built taller walls between “valuable” and “useless.” It turned classrooms into pipelines and dreams into liabilities.

You study history, literature, philosophy—not to earn, but to _understand_. But the system only values things that can be sold. And if you can’t sell it, it’s not real. 

---

## The Crime of Being Human in an Inhuman World

You want to cry, but it’s unproductive. You want to feel, but it doesn’t scale. So you shut it down. You optimize. You “build resilience.” And one day you wake up, alien to yourself.

And in some dark corner of that broken soul, crime can seem logical. Not because you’re evil—but because the world has made you feel you don’t belong unless you comply. You don’t matter unless you produce.

This isn’t justification. It’s dissection.

---

## A System That Trains Us in Insecurity

Society doesn’t just fail individuals—it programs them.

Every jobless graduate is a byproduct of a system that glorified uniformity and murdered curiosity. Every burnout is evidence that we were never taught rest. Every child who drew planets and wrote poems but now clicks ads for a living is part of this silent grief we call "adulthood."

Globalization promised connection. But it often delivered standardization. One language. One currency. One job market. And if you didn’t fit in, you were out.

---

## Some Intelligence Doesn’t Pay—and That’s a Tragedy

Not all intellect is marketable. Not all wisdom is brandable. But the system doesn’t care.

You can quote Marcus Aurelius, speak seven languages, understand the nuances of postcolonialism—and still be seen as lazy, broke, and irrelevant. Meanwhile, someone who copies JavaScript off StackOverflow is hailed as a genius because they make 25 LPA.

It’s a cruel joke. But it's the world we live in.

---

## Where Do We Go From Here?

The solution isn’t just revolution—it’s _recognition_.

We need to stop measuring people by what they produce. We need to revalue things that don't generate profit—care, contemplation, wonder. We need to build a society that asks: _"What do you love?"_ instead of _"What do you do?"_

And maybe—just maybe—the boy who loved history won’t be made to feel like a failure for simply being himself.

---

> "The most terrible poverty is loneliness and the feeling of being unloved." — Mother Teresa

Progress means nothing if it costs us our empathy. A society that trains people to suppress their uniqueness will always reap violence. Not because humans are evil—but because we’ve forgotten how to treat them as human.
